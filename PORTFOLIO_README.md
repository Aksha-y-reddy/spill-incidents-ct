## Project Overview

This comprehensive data science project analyzes environmental spill incidents in Connecticut using official data from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP). The analysis addresses critical public safety questions through advanced statistical methods and data visualization techniques.

### Research Objectives

The project addresses four key research questions:

1. **Geographic Risk Assessment**: Which Connecticut towns have the highest spill incident rates?
2. **Temporal Safety Analysis**: What times of day pose the greatest risk to citizens?
3. **Substance Impact Study**: Which types of substances are most commonly involved in spills?
4. **Future Risk Projection**: What will be the impact on residents from continued incidents?

## Key Research Findings

### Research Validation Achieved: 100%

| **Research Area** | **Key Finding** | **Validation** |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Geographic** | Top 5 towns: Southington, Groton, Hartford, New Britain, Enfield | 5/5 Expected towns confirmed |
| **Substances** | Petroleum Products account for 63.4% of all incidents | Dominance validated |
| **Causes** | Motor Vehicle Accidents are primary cause (32.1%) | Hypothesis confirmed |
| **Scale** | 17,541 incidents analyzed across 177 Connecticut towns | Comprehensive coverage |

### Critical Insights for Public Safety

- **High-Risk Locations**: Southington leads with 598 incidents (2019-2022)
- **Primary Threat**: Petroleum products pose the greatest environmental risk
- **Main Cause**: Traffic-related incidents account for 1 in 3 spills
- **Geographic Spread**: Risk distributed across 177 towns statewide
